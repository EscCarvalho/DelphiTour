1. Users have lots of DB aware controls. - Demo 1 shows DB aware controls using VLB. You don’t have to be exclusive to VLB or TDataSource. This is done on purpose.	
- Show data changing on the screen and updating the list view form the data. To VLB enables you to use controls that are non data aware as super cool data aware controls. 
- Its kind of cool that VLB can use TListView as a super grid.

2. Demo for the objects shows the grouping of TListView (which you can also use with data from a grid) 
- Grouping turned on on TListView
- Livebindings managing it easy.

Show the TListView as Report and then add the columns and off you go with LiveBindings as normal. Zero Code and more powerful that the DB aware controls is the main thing to explain, and that they work with DB aware controls.
