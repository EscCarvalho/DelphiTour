Meeting Organizer - Custom ListView iOS App 

This sample shows off custom listview appearance modes that are now fully supported with ControlType = Platform on iOS. 
Do not share this demo outside of Embarcadero as it includes my (Sarina DuPont) Kinvey credentials. 

To view the data at design time, right-click on the BackendQuery component on your form and select "Execute".

If this app is run on other platforms, it will be rendered using the bitmap styles. 

You can show/hide the non-visual controls on the form using CTRL + H.
